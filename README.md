# FLARE: Lattice-based Private Set Intersection System

FLARE (Fast Lattice-based Authenticated Range Encryption) is a post-quantum secure Private Set Intersection (PSI) system built using lattice-based cryptography and homomorphic encryption techniques. It enables two parties to identify common elements in their datasets without revealing any other sensitive information.

## üîê Features

- **Post-Quantum Security**: Built on lattice-based cryptography, resistant to quantum computer attacks
- **Private Set Intersection**: Securely compute intersections between datasets without data leakage
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Perform computations on encrypted data using the Lattigo library
- **Merkle Tree Accumulators**: Efficient cryptographic data structures for scalable operations
- **Parallel Processing**: Optimized performance using Go's concurrency primitives
- **Database Integration**: SQLite-based storage for cryptographic accumulators and transaction data
- **Flexible CLI**: Command-line interface supporting various encryption modes and parameters

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

- **Cryptographic Core** (`pkg/LE/`): Lattice-based encryption scheme implementation
- **Matrix Operations** (`pkg/matrix/`): Efficient polynomial and vector arithmetic
- **Storage Layer** (`internal/storage/`): Database operations and transaction management
- **Crypto Interface** (`internal/crypto/`): High-level cryptographic operations and PSI protocol
- **CLI Tool** (`cmd/Flare/`): User-friendly command-line interface

## üìã Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.1 or higher
- SQLite3
- Git

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SanthoshCheemala/FLARE.git
cd FLARE
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

3. Build the application:
```bash
go build -o flare cmd/Flare/main.go
```

## üíª Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Encrypt transaction data
./flare -encrypt -columns="type,amount" -LIMIT=100

# Decrypt transaction data
./flare -decrypt -columns="type,amount" -LIMIT=100

# Process with merged columns
./flare -encrypt -columns="type,amount" -columns-merge="user_id,timestamp" -LIMIT=50
```

### Command Line Options

- `-encrypt`: Enable encryption mode
- `-decrypt`: Enable decryption mode
- `-columns`: Comma-separated list of columns to process (required)
- `-columns-merge`: Comma-separated list of columns to merge for encryption
- `-LIMIT`: Number of rows to process from the beginning (default: 100)

## üìÅ Data Structure

The system expects a SQLite database with financial transaction data. Create your database at `data/transactions.db` with a table named `finanical_transactions` containing the columns you want to process.

Example table structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE finanical_transactions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    type TEXT,
    amount REAL,
    user_id TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME
);
```

- **Matrix Dimension (N)**: 4
- **Security Level**: Post-quantum secure against lattice attacks

### Performance Optimizations
